[From a product designer's perspective](http://pmblog.quora.com/The-10-Books-Every-Product-Manager-Should-Read), "I consider this the canonical product design book, and it's a great place for anyone to start, especially if you don't already have a background in design. It will show you how to look at the world in terms of design. **After reading this book you'll start to notice good and bad designs all around you.**".
- [*Decode and Conquer: Answers to Product Management Interviews*](https://www.amazon.com/Decode-Conquer-Answers-Management-Interviews/dp/0615930417/) by [Lewis C. Lin]()
- [*The Lean Startup](https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation/dp/0307887898) by [Eric Ries](). One of the worst things a PM can do is build a product that nobody wants. This book shows you how to avoid that by **building a minimum viable product and paying attention to the metrics that matter**.
- [*Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability*](http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758) by [Steve Krug]().

## :star: Not PM books but must read

As a PM you need to be organized and responsive. This book teaches a system that will make you feel like you just found more hours in the day.

By thinking about "Next Actions" you can make progress on tasks that would otherwise be lost to procrastination.
